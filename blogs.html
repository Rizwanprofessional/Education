            English students from attending the University of Paris.[2] After
            disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some
            academics fled north-east to Cambridge where they established what
            became the University of Cambridge.[12] The two English ancient
            universities share many common features and are jointly referred to
            as Oxbridge. Both are ranked among the most prestigious universities
            in the world.

            The University of Oxford is a collegiate research university in
            Oxford, England. There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096,[2]
            making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and
            the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation.
